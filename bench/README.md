# Benchmark

The site says which models fit a dataset. This directory is where that claim
gets tested against real data instead of being asserted.

## Why a Python copy of the profiler

The page measures a dataset in the browser; the benchmark has to measure
thousands of datasets in Python. Two implementations means they can drift
apart, and a benchmark that scores signatures the site never shows would prove
nothing. So `tests/test_agreement.py` runs the site's own JavaScript profiler
(`tools/js_profile.mjs`) over every fixture and compares it with the Python
port, column by column and target by target: parsing, column types, every
axis, class balance, PSI drift. Any disagreement fails.

Keeping them honest turned up one real bug: date detection used to call
`Date.parse`, which is only specified for ISO strings, so Chrome and Safari
disagreed about formats like `04.01.2025` and the same file could be measured
differently in different browsers. Both sides now use the same explicit list
of date shapes (`site/js/dates.js`, `dcn/dates.py`).

## Running

```bash
cd bench
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

## Layout

```
dcn/csvread.py   CSV reading, ported from site/js/csv.js
dcn/stats.py     PSI and JavaScript number semantics
dcn/dates.py     the shared date shapes
dcn/profile.py   the profiler, ported from site/js/profile.js
tools/           the JavaScript side of the agreement test
tests/           the agreement test and its awkward CSVs
```

## Next

- a model registry mapping taxonomy codes to estimators
- a runner over the PMLB datasets, with per-model time budget and checkpoints
- regret against three baselines: always-LightGBM, a random eligible model,
  and the best model available
